Mechanism Design Supporting Materials

This folder contains all supporting materials related to Problem Set 2: Mechanism Design. It includes calculations, diagrams, simulations, and references that complement the main PDF submission.

Contents:

Calculations: Step-by-step numeric and formula-based work used to support the design of mechanisms and verify theoretical properties.

Diagrams: Visual representations of mechanisms, showing allocation rules, payment structures, and incentive flows.

Simulations: Code or spreadsheet files used to simulate mechanism outcomes and test robustness (if applicable).

References: Academic papers, textbooks, or other sources cited to provide theoretical background and methodology.

All materials are organized to facilitate reproducibility and verification of results. Any additional files should follow the same structure for clarity.
