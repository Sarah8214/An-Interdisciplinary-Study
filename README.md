# ðŸŒŸ BRIDGING GAME THEORY, MECHANISM DESIGN, AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE  
## Author: Chenlei Tao

## **Abstract**  
This proposal explores the intersection of computational microeconomics, behavioral analysis, and institutional governance. We first study a two-player repeated bargaining game using analytical solutions, computational simulations (**NashPy, Game Theory Explorer**), and human/AI experiments (**oTree, ChatGPT-5**) to investigate equilibrium behavior and bounded rationality. Next, we examine first-price sealed-bid auctions, analyzing how the number of bidders affects the winnerâ€™s curse through both simulations and theory. Finally, inspired by governance challenges in a university Student Leader Board, we propose a hybrid quadratic-Borda voting mechanism to balance fairness, efficiency, and legitimacy, evaluated via computational simulations and blockchain-based implementation. The integrated framework shows how theory, experiments, and computation can guide practical solutions in economic and institutional contexts, aligning with DKUâ€™s focus on communication, collaboration, global perspective, and purposeful engagement.
