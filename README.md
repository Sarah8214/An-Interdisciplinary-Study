# Claim Game: An Interdisciplinary Study

## Abstract
This project investigates the **Claim Game**, where two players simultaneously demand portions of 100 points. If the total demand is ≤ 100, both receive their claims; otherwise, both get zero.  
The study combines three perspectives:  
- **Economist** — Theoretical equilibrium analysis, efficiency, and fairness.  
- **Computational Scientist** — Payoff matrix construction, equilibrium computation (NashPy/QuantEcon), and SPNE analysis (Game Theory Explorer).  
- **Behavioral Scientist** — oTree experiment, comparison of human vs. LLM decisions, and interpretation of discrepancies.

## Task Summary
- **Part 1 (Economist):** Define the game, state equilibrium concept, solve equilibria, analyze efficiency/fairness, and discuss bounded rationality.  
- **Part 2 (Computational Scientist):** Build normal-form payoff matrices, compute equilibria in Colab, construct extensive-form game in GTE, and compare results.  
- **Part 3 (Behavioral Scientist):** Deploy oTree version, run human session, run LLM session, and conduct comparative analysis.
