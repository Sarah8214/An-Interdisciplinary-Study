# Economist Module

This folder contains the **Part 1 â€” Economist** analysis of the bargaining game.  
It is based on game theory and equilibrium concepts, following the structure below:

1. **Game and Equilibrium Concept**  
   Formal definition of the two-player bargaining game, its rules, and payoff function.

2. **Analytical Solution**  
   Derivation of Nash equilibria, discussion of efficiency, fairness, and focal points.

3. **Interpretation**  
   Economic insights, realism, coordination issues, repeated rounds, bounded rationality, and computational tractability.

The content is split across three separate files for clarity:

- [`1_game_and_equilibrium.md`](./1_game_and_equilibrium.md)  
- [`2_analytical_solution.md`](./2_analytical_solution.md)  
- [`3_interpretation.md`](./3_interpretation.md)
