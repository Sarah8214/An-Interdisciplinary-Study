# 2. Analytical Solution

### Pure-Strategy Equilibria
All pairs \((s_1^\ast, s_2^\ast)\) such that \(s_1^\ast + s_2^\ast = 100\) are pure-strategy Nash equilibria.

- If one player increases her demand, the sum exceeds 100 and her payoff drops to 0.  
- If she decreases her demand, her payoff falls directly.  
Thus, no unilateral deviation is profitable.

### Symmetry and Focal Point
Although many equilibria exist, \((50,50)\) is a natural **symmetric focal equilibrium**, because it is both equal and easily recognized.

### Efficiency
Every equilibrium with \(s_1 + s_2 = 100\) is **Pareto efficient**, since the full resource is allocated and total surplus = 100.  
From a utilitarian perspective, all equilibria are equivalent (\(\sum_i u_i = 100\)).

### Fairness
- Extreme equilibria such as (100,0) are highly unequal.  
- The symmetric split (50,50) is perfectly equal and uniquely satisfies envy-freeness and proportionality.  

Thus, efficiency is universal, but fairness varies greatly.
