# 3. Interpretation

### Realism and Coordination
In the one-shot game (R=1), equilibrium multiplicity creates a **coordination problem**.  
While theory predicts many equilibria, experiments often cluster around equal splits, reflecting fairness norms and focal points (Roth, 1995).

### Multiplicity and Refinements
The large set of equilibria is not equally compelling.  
Refinements (e.g., trembling-hand perfection) suggest extreme allocations are less stable, while the equal split is more robust and commonly observed.

### Repeated Rounds (R=2,5)
In finitely repeated games, any stage-game NE repeated each round is a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE).  
However, repeated interaction enables **learning** and **history dependence**.  
More rounds encourage convergence toward fairer and more stable splits.  
→ Prediction: outcomes closer to (50,50) in the 2- and 5-round treatments.

### Bounded Rationality
Because players cannot enumerate all equilibria in such a large action space, they use heuristics like “demand half” or “repeat last round.”  
This explains the empirical prevalence of equal splits despite theoretical multiplicity.

### Computational Tractability
Our game is analytically simple (\(s_1 + s_2 = 100\)), but in general, computing NE is **PPAD-complete** (Daskalakis, Goldberg & Papadimitriou, 2009).  
This game serves as a tractable case to illustrate the gap between **theory** and **computation**.
